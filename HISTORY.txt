%CSBP_solver Version 2.0, January 2013
20/01/2013 Pan Zhang: 
1.) Code is re-organized, especially CSBP_Solver.m.
2.) AMP is optimized, now it is much faster than before.
3.) BP is added as an option(just finished, needs tests), set opt.method='BP' to use BP instead of AMP.

and options. So far, the fully-TAP version is not implemented.
